# Course Notes

* Build off of the ExploreCali project from [Creating Your First Spring Boot Microservice](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/creating-your-first-spring-boot-microservice)

## Role Based Security

* Roles have access to services
* Users are assigned roles

## Dockerizing

* I've used docker-compose, the course does not.
* The course uses a docker-maven-plugin from Spotify to generate the docker image
  * I'm using gradle, and have not looked for a similar gradle plugin
