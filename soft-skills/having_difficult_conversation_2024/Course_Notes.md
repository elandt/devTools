# Course Notes

## The Foundation

* Conflict is a part of life
* Conflict is often viewed as a win-lose situation
* Conflict: A serious disagreement or argument, typically long-lasting
* Reframing Conflict
  * An opportunity to grow personally and professionally
  * A chance to increase understanding
  * A method to achieve a mission
  * Thinking about conflict in this way can result in resolving it more easily and sooner
* If you aren't having some conflict, you probably aren't growing
* A conversation that seems difficult to one person may seem straightforward to another
  * Some variables in play
    * The situation
      * Is something happening that shouldn't
      * Is something not happening that should
    * The relationship
      * Conversionations with people you care about are often more difficult because you don't want to alienate the person or damage the relationship
    * The power structure
      * Is the person a(n):
        * superior - parent, boss, etc.
        * equal - colleague, peer, spouse
        * subordinate - employee/direct report, mentee, child
    * The emotions and feelings
      * Your own emotions/feelings about the situation
      * The other parties emotions/feelings
  * Identify a difficult conversation
    * Describe the situation
    * Define the relationship
      * Scale of 1 -10, how much do you care?
      * What's the perceived risk?
    * What's the power structure?
    * What emotions and feelings are present?
* Identify the power structure and patterns in conflict
  * Power structures
    * Less power - e.g. a direct report
    * Equal power - e.g. a peer
    * More power - e.g. a boss
    * Power structures influence conversations
      * Our brains are wired to avoid threats and approach rewards
      * Approaching someone with more power naturally puts our brains in a protective mode
  * Dysfunctional patterns
    * Avoidance
    * Shutting down
    * Aggression
    * Sarcasm
    * Crying
    * History with a person can lead to "I already know how they're going to react" mentality
      * This simply means that given the history, we engage in certain patterns
      * Knowing the patterns that the other party typically uses is easy
      * Reflecting on your own pattern usage is often more difficult, but can be key to having more productive conversations
      * Sometimes when we change our own patterns the other party's pattern also changes
  * Preparing for difficuly conversations
    * Identify the power structure
    * Recognize the patterns
      * We can change our own patterns to try to allow for more productive conversations

## Dos and Don'ts of Difficult Conversations

* Control your emotions
  * Don't initiate a conversation when your emotions are high
* Talk face-to-face
  * Writing can be easier, but it can also lose tone, be misinterpreted, etc.
  * Inappropriate digital communication
    * Discussing performance
    * Arguing
    * Pointing out mistakes
    * Defending yourself
    * If triggered by someone else's email

* Seek understanding
  * Avoid fingerpointing
* Stay focused
  * Stay present by keeping your end result in mind
  * Don't get sidetracked by the past, non-relevant issues, etc.
* Best practices for preparing for a difficult conversation
  * Learn to manage our narative (or our narative will manage us)
    * 85% of our thoughts are either negative or repetitive
    * If we aren't aware of the stories we tell ourselves, we start to believe everything we think
      * This will likely lead to unproductive conversations
  * Cultivate curiosity
    * Being a know-it-all closes off possibilities
    * Confirmation Bias: the tendency to seek evidence and interpret information to confirm preconceived notions
      * Countering Confirmation Bias
        * Be curious
          * Display an eagerness to understand
          * Ask questions
          * Engage in a dialogue
  * Go to the source
    * The person that can actually make the change we seek
    * Sometimes we need to go to a coach or trusted advisor to process our thoughts or get a plan of action
      * This reaches problematic if you've told the story multiple times/to multiple people who always see things from your point of view
      * Refrain from overly venting
    * What is my narrative about the other person?
    * What questions will break my bias and start a dialogue?
    * Have I initiated a conversation with the source of the problem?

## How to Prepate for Difficual Conversations

* Can you articulate what needs to change?
  * If you can't, the conversation will just come across as complaining
* Get Clear
  * What are they doing?
  * What should they do?
* Neutralize negative emotions
  * Take notice of the negative language you may have used to describe the other party
  * Redirect your focus to how you can benefit the other person
    * They're human and can make mistakes, JUST LIKE YOU
    * They deserve a chance to be better
* Never start a conversation when you can't articulate the situation
* Avoid labels and neutralize the negative thoughts you may have about the person
* Control the direction of the difficult conversation
  * Clarify your primary and secondary purpose before the conversations
    * Identify possible distracting phrases
      * Examples that may apply to a situation where an employee is completing their work, but with delays
        * I don't think this is fair
        * That's not how we did it before
        * My other boss was OK with it
        * Others think you're a control freak
    * Redirect if distracting phrases come up
      * Acknowledge their statement
      * Redirect to preferred behvaior/main topic
      * Be sure to pause to allow time to reflect on the request
      * Always keep tone polite and neutral
  * Be chances for success are when...
    * ... you're clear about the goal
    * ... can keep the conversation moving forward, free from distraction
* Avoid exaggeration and escalation in difficult conversations
  * Be aware of your exaggerations
    * We're often unaware of how often we use exaggeration
      * "I'm completely worn out" rather than "I'm tired"
      * "I'm starving" rather than "I'm hungry"
    * Take responsibility for your emotional experience
      * Others may have triggered an emotional response, but you have to own your emotions
        * "I am frustrated" vs "John Doe makes me feel frustration"
          * "I'm frustrated" takes ownership
          * "John Doe makes..." is blaming John
    * Separate your experience from the issue at hand
      * Experience: your frustation
      * Issue: the action that's triggering your frustation - e.g. someone repeatedly interupting you or others during a meeting
    * Ask for what you want
      * Don't bring up a checklist of their wrongdoings
      * Identify one behavior you want to see
    * Speak about specific and observable behaviors
      * Avoid using "always" and "never"
        * Instead of "John, you always interupt others..." or "John, you never let others offer their opinions."
        * Try "John, I observed..." and be specific
      * Referencing specific, observable behaviors can increase the odds of a successful conversation
  * Exaggeration within a difficult conversation often leads to escalation

## Where to Start: How to Initiate the Conversation

* Learn the blueprint for a difficult conversation
  * State your purpose
    * "I want to talk about your record keeping"
  * Present your observations
    * Can be tricky
      * Can easily fall into
        * Blaming
        * Assumption-making
    * State the facts
      * "I noticed you aren't using the new cloud system for your documentation"
      * Mind your tone
        * Don't be intimidating or judgemental
  * Listen and invite feedback
    * Ask open-ended questions
      * What are your thoughts?
      * Can you fill me in?
      * Walk me through your process?
    * If you hear a lot of excuses or blame, it means they're in a state of resistance
      * Acknowledge their emotions, but don't get drawn away from the purpose of the conversation
      * "I know this may seem difficult and it may be frustrating, but let's get back to talking about..."
  * State your request
    * "Would you be willing to work with Rob for two days so he can train you on the new system?"
    * They'll either agree or resist
    * It's key to be clear about the request
  * Create accountability
    * "Let's get a meeting on the calendar two weeks from today and we'll review your documentation and discuss your progress"
  * This blueprint doesn't guarantee a successful result, but keeps control of the conversation and focus on the successful end result
* Find your "why" in a difficult conversation
  * "Is this difficult conversation going to be worth it?"
    * Easy to get stuck at this question
    * Have to resolve this inner conflict before you can successfully engage in a difficult conversation
      * Focus on what you want from the conversation, not what you don't want
      * Find a compelling reason why
      * Template for resolving the inner conflict
        * I want to have a conversation about ...
          * e.x. "I want to explore some ways we can elevate your performance"
        * My reason why is ...
          * e.x. "The reason why is that I want to support your success and help you overcome some pitfalls"

## Dealing with Resistance

* Deal with resistance during a difficult conversation
  * Either the conversation isn't happening or it's not going the direction you want
  * S.A.N.D
    * Stuck - indecision, avoidance, procrastination in regards to having the conversation at all
      * Pick your battles
        * What's the purpose of the conversation?
        * Your reason why should benefit the other person as well as you
    * Attached - overly attached to how the person is going to respond, losing sight of the big picture, your "why"
      * Resist the desire to control the other person
        * You can't control how they react
    * Negative - complaining is a form of this
      * Take a breath and acknowledge their reality
      * Redirect by asking, what choices do you have
    * Distracted - a lot like avoidance, but avoidance is _before_ the conversation whereas distraction occurs _within_ it
      * Occurs when the other person feels resistance - starts to blame you, gets angry, starts to change the focus and direction of the conversation in some way
      * Take a breath
      * Refocus on the issue at hand
* Use radical listening to stay present
  * The one who listens first controls the direction of the conversation
  * Controlling your urge...
    * ... to be right
    * ... to be understood
    * ... to win
  * Radical listening is a habit that can be learned AND works both in conversations you initiate and ones you're on the receiving end of
  * Listen first - until the other person _feels_ heard, you'll only get defensiveness and disagreement
    * The one who listens first changes the conversation
    * It's not about agreeing, it's about acknowledging their reality and being sincerely curious to understand their point of view
  * Practicing Radical Listening
    * Take a deep breath
      * Builds a tiny space between stimulus and response - gives time to respond thoughtfully rather than instinctually, habitually, or defensively
    * Acknowledge their reality
      * EVEN if you don't agree with it
        * Phrases like, "I see," "I think I understand," or "I hear you" can help with this
        * Examples
          * "I see, so you thought is was a good idea"
          * "I think I understand, you were upset and didn't mean for me to take it that way"
      * Once they confirm, take another deep breath
        * Avoid the urge to argue
    * Ask them to say more
      * Give them the chance to expand
        * Phrases like
          * Say more about that
          * I didn't realize you felt that way, do you still feel that way?
      * Until someone feel thoroughly understood, they won't consider another point of view
        * They'll feel threatened and continue to argue, withdraw, and make you wrong
    * Look for signs they feel heard
      * This may look/sound like
        * Seeming more open and curious to consider your viewpoints
        * Demeanor may soften
    * If you need more time to process, you can end the conversation letting them know you have more to say
* Avoid resisting resistance
  * What does resisting resistance mean?
    * They had an emotional response to what you said, and their response triggers you
    * Emotions take over and you're no longer in control of the conversation
  * Resistance Trap
    * Anger
    * Argument
    * Acquiescence - when you give in
    * Avoidance
  * Steps to avoid resisting resistance
    * Imagine the difference kinds of resistance
      * What might occur, how might they react
      * Anger, argue, distract, blame, cry
    * Create space
      * Let them finish their resistance
      * Don't try to change the subject
      * Don't take on their pain
      * Don't try to soothe them
      * Don't make them wrong
      * This may feel like an eternity, but keep breathing and let the moment pass
    * Acknowledge their experience
      * Example
        * Them: "You don't understand"
        * You: "Perhaps I don't understand, I'd like to understand more"
        * When they start to wind down say, "I think I understand"
  * Allowing someone's resistance without adding your own is all about emotional control and staying present
    * Avoiding the urge to get angry, argue, avoid, or acquiesce
    * This takes practice
* Learn the magic phrase to test for resistance
  * Resistance - any form of negativity or nonacceptance; an unwillingness to move forward
    * Examples
      * "You aren't giving me any options"
      * "This isn't fair"
      * "I don't have enough time to do what you want"
      * "It would cost too much"
      * "What you're asking for is just not possible"
      * "I've told you; I've already tried that"
  * When starting a conversation, anticipate a lack of willingness
    * Change --> Discomfort --> Resistance --> Unproductive conversations
  * Frame your request with "Would you be willing...?"
    * Implies there's a choice, and tests for resistance
    * Can follow-up with acknowledging their reality, and reasking if they're willing to do what's requested, this technique can be repeated as long as there's resistance
* Working with people who are not willing to change
  * Most difficult conversations boil down to one of the following
    * Asking some to change something
    * Cleaning up a past mistake that you have made
  * What can you do if they continue to resist?
    * A - Acceptance: Accepting the situation; you may have little choice or power in the matter
    * B - Boundaries: Set a boundary; this is about a choice you make, and not about changing the other person
    * C - Change: Make a dramatic change; examples could be transferring departments, leaving a company, etc.
  * Purposeful conversations have the power to improve relationships, working conditions, and productivity

## How to Make Tough Decisions

* Personal vs professional conflicts
  * Biggest barrier in every difficult conversation is the emotion
  * Environment and culture shapes the ability to resolve conflict
    * Professional environment
      * Companies can value results over people, leading to more natural resistance
      * They can also value integrity, fairness, accountability, and growth which all support having difficult conversations
    * Personal
      * Some families and/or friendships can be dysfunctional making it harder to have difficult conversations
    * Family businesses can blur these lines
      * Both company culture and family culture are in play
    * The key to having successful difficult conversations is to start with awareness
    * Becoming aware of your environment
      * What pressing issue are you facing?
      * Is it personal or professional?
      * What are the emotional barriers?
      * What are the cultural barriers?
* Create new habits around difficult conversations
  * Address uncomfortable situations as soon as possible
    * The sooner you address the issue, the easier it is to correct
  * Ask for what you want
  * Set boundaries
    * You control the boundaries, not the other person
    * Don't set a boundary without telling the other person
    * If you set a boundary, you need to execute on that boundary
      * If you say you need to leave at 1:30, leave at 1:30
